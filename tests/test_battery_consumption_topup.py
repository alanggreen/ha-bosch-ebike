"""Standalone tests for the battery-consumption top-up window - run with:
python3 tests/test_battery_consumption_topup.py

coordinator.py imports Home Assistant, so it cannot be imported directly in
this dependency-free suite. battery_capacity_wh, _track_battery_consumption
and _activity_sort_key are extracted from its source and exec'd on their own,
mirroring test_trick_sensors.py's approach for sensor.py. dt_util is stubbed
with a controllable "now" so the top-up window's timing can be driven
deterministically across simulated polls without any real sleeping.

Forum report this covers (issue #67): a rider recharged their battery
immediately after a ride; the ride's reported consumption came out too low
against the real-world value. Root cause: _track_battery_consumption
attributes a bike's deliveredWhOverLifetime delta to a new activity exactly
once, at whichever poll first sees it - if Bosch's cloud counter is still
catching up with the ride's true energy use at that moment, the shortfall
silently disappears into the next poll's baseline instead of ever reaching
the ride. The top-up window keeps a bike's most recent activity open for a
bounded time so a later counter increase - with no newer ride in between -
still lands on it, corroborated against the bike's own odometer so a
counter increase that actually belongs to a second, not-yet-synced ride
does not get transplanted onto the wrong one, and measured against a
monotonic high-water mark so a counter dip that later recovers is never
credited twice.

Also covers issue #78: a fresh install (or a long HA downtime) can surface
a whole backlog of already-completed historical activities together in one
poll, while deliveredWhOverLifetime itself barely moved in the short
real-world gap since the previous poll - splitting that tiny delta across
the backlog by distance produced a wh_per_km around 100-1000x too low (a
reported 0.01 Wh/km -> 75000 km "range" instead of ~10-15 Wh/km -> ~50-75
km). The fix is plausibility-gated, not a blanket age filter: a poll's
whole new-activity batch is still split proportionally across everything
(old activities included) as long as the implied wh_per_km is physically
plausible (MIN_PLAUSIBLE_WH_PER_KM) - correct even across a long gap when
real riding happened throughout it. Only once the whole batch's implied
wh_per_km is implausible does it get narrowed to just the
CONSUMPTION_BACKLOG_CUTOFF-recent activities, and only if THAT narrower
split is itself plausible; otherwise the whole batch is left with no
consumption entries at all rather than a still-wrong number - already
handled gracefully everywhere consumed_wh is read. An earlier, unconditional
age-only version of this fix was caught in review before release: it wrongly
zeroed older, equally real rides and inflated recent ones whenever a long
downtime had genuine riding throughout it (see
test_downtime_with_real_riding_still_splits_across_whole_batch).
