# real energy use for a while after the ride first appears - reported (issue
# #67 forum thread) after a fast recharge started right after the ride ended.
# Long enough to span several poll cycles at the default scan interval

# deliveredWhOverLifetime increase is trusted as "the same watched ride
# still catching up" rather than "a genuinely separate ride that just
# hasn't synced into the activity list yet". A backend-lag top-up should
# correlate with NO meaningful new riding; real riding almost always moves
# the odometer by far more than ordinary reporting noise. Generous enough

# second/replacement pack, or replacing the drive unit, makes the counter
# start over near zero, which looks identical to a glitch dip except for
# magnitude: a glitch is a small wobble, a swap drops nearly the WHOLE
# lifetime total at once. Small enough that no plausible glitch exceeds it,
# large enough that no plausible swap stays under it - see
# _track_battery_consumption's baseline update for why the distinction
# matters (a dip must not regress the reference point, but a genuine reset
# must, or the bike's consumption tracking stays wrongly stuck at the old
# battery's final reading until the new one's own counter climbs back past
# it - months to years of silence, not one extra poll).

# swap) ages out within a reasonable number of real charges.

# this direction avoids a circular import between the two.

# How old an activity's end (or start) time may be to still count as part of
# the "recent" subset _track_battery_consumption falls back to once a whole
# batch's implied wh_per_km has already failed MIN_PLAUSIBLE_WH_PER_KM
# - NOT a blanket age filter on its own (an unconditional one wrongly
# reassigns real energy away from equally-legitimate older rides in a
# downtime-with-real-riding batch, since that batch's whole-distance split
# was already correct and never reaches this fallback at all). An activity
# excluded here still gets no consumption entry rather than a fabricated one
# - already handled gracefully everywhere consumed_wh is read
# (compute_range_estimate skips activities with no entry, same as an
# unattributed one). Matches the 48 h precedent already used for a related
# "how stale can Bosch's cloud data be before we stop chasing it" judgement
# call in _recheck_recent_activity_distances (issue #31) - though that
# function fails CLOSED on a missing timestamp (nothing to fetch a GPS
# correction against) where this one fails OPEN (nothing to judge staleness
# against, so it stays eligible rather than silently losing real data).

    # comment it ran on EVERY poll, so `None` effectively meant "refill me
    # from Bosch" rather than "no override" - which made clearing an override
    # impossible, since the next poll silently restored it. It also persisted
    # Bosch's own value as if the user had entered it, permanently shadowing
    # any later Bosch-side change.
    #
    # It was also redundant: every consumer of these overrides already falls
    # back to bike["serviceDue"] on its own (sensor.py's service_due_in_*
    # sensors, _check_service_and_maintenance below). Only the two editable
    # entities lacked that fallback, so they now do it at read time instead
    # (see date.py / number.py). `None` therefore now means exactly what the
    # user expects: no override, use Bosch's value, or nothing if Bosch has none.

        A physical odometer can only increase, but the cloud's own reported
        value has been observed to briefly dip below what it reported on an
        earlier poll before catching back up, showing as a visible drop in
        the history graph (issue #60). Display-only by design: this never
        touches the bike dict itself, so multi-bike ride attribution
        (odometer-matching) and maintenance/service-due calculations, both
        of which need the genuine cloud value, are unaffected - only what
        this one sensor shows is floored.

        Also naturally backfills a missing/zero reading (e.g. a BES2 poll
        where the /statistics fetch failed and no odometer was reported at
        all that round) with the last known-good value instead of a
        momentary drop to 0, since max(0, floor) is just the floor.

        When this bike has an unambiguous linked live odometer entity
        configured (issue #60 follow-up), its current state is folded into
        the same max() so the display jumps to the live value the moment
        the bike reconnects at home, instead of waiting for the next Bosch
        cloud sync (which can take hours) - the live entity already
        publishes in km, same unit as the cloud value. Only accepted when
        BOTH fresh (changed within LIVE_ODOMETER_BOOST_TOLERANCE - a bridge
        that hasn't seen the bike in a long time keeps reporting its last
        real state as "available" indefinitely, see issues #31/#54 for why
        that distinction matters for this exact class of entity) AND
        plausible (no more than LIVE_ODOMETER_BOOST_MAX_EXCESS_KM above the
        current cloud/floor value - guards against a unit mixup, e.g. a
        misconfigured entity exposing raw metres instead of km, or a
        decode glitch, either of which would otherwise poison this floor
        permanently, unlike the bounded, per-activity use of the same
        entity elsewhere in this file).

        Freshness is checked against last_changed, not last_updated: HA
        bumps last_updated on every write, including a reconnect (HA
        restart, ESPHome reboot, WiFi blip) that merely re-reports the
        SAME cached value, which would otherwise look deceptively "fresh".
        last_changed only moves when the reported VALUE itself actually
        changes, so a stale value replayed unchanged across a reconnect
        keeps its true (old) last_changed. This does not cover the case
        where Home Assistant's own in-memory state is wiped by a full HA
        restart (last_changed also resets then, since there is nothing
        to compare against) - the plausibility bound is the remaining
        safety net for that narrower case.

        Known, accepted limitation: a genuine hardware replacement (new
        drive unit with a lower true odometer) would also stay clamped to
        the old bike's mileage until a new value grows past it again -
        rare enough not to warrant reset-detection logic.

        Floor increases are persisted to disk in a debounced way (see
        _schedule_odometer_floor_save()): this method itself only runs when
        an entity is actually read/written, which is NOT the same as the
        coordinator's own state_changed-gated save. Without this, a floor
        raised purely by the live-entity boost (no new activity, no
        consumption change - nothing that flips state_changed) stayed
        correct in memory for as long as the process kept running, but
        reverted to whatever was last saved on any later HA/integration
        restart, since nothing had ever written the higher value to disk in
        between (issue #60 - reported as a "sawtooth" by crazy-joe28: the
        live-boosted value held fine poll after poll within one running
        session, but a restart in between silently dropped it back to the
        stale, disk-persisted floor).
