"""Pure two-phase charge-rate estimation.

Charging a Li-ion pack is not linear: it moves fast below roughly 80%, then
tapers off noticeably in the constant-voltage phase above it. This module
learns two separate rates from a bike's own charge history - one for the
0-80% span, one for 80-100% - and projects a remaining-time estimate for
each of the two milestones users actually care about.

Deliberately free of Home Assistant imports, mirroring range_estimate.py,
so the dependency-free suite under tests/ can cover it directly.

# a handful of barely-there tours cannot pass the count gate alone. Without
# this, e.g. three sessions that each nudge 1 point across the 80% line would
# satisfy MIN_SESSIONS_PER_PHASE and be reported "trusted" off of essentially
# no real above-80 data. The above-80 phase only spans 20 points (80-100%),
# so 10.0 sets the floor at roughly half of that narrower phase's total
# width - enough that the sessions backing an "above 80" rate must have
# covered real ground in the phase that most needs it. For the below-80
# phase (80 points wide) this is a proportionally lower bar, but it still
# rules out the same degenerate case of several tiny near-boundary sessions.

    exactly what the two-phase split exists to avoid).
